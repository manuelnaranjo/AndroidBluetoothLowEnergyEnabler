Bluetooth Low Energy Enabler for Nexus 7, 10 and Galaxy installer

This is the project I use to generate:
* https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.manuelnaranjo.btle.installer2

In order to get a full build you will need an Android AOSP checkout and some
patches, this will generate the installer and may reflect the last available
binaries.
